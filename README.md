# Image Captioning in Google Colab

This project uses a pre-trained BLIP image captioning model to generate captions for selected images in a Google Colab notebook.

## How to Use

1. Open the notebook in Google Colab.
2. Run the first cell to install dependencies.
3.  Upload your images (JPG, PNG, etc.).
4.  Execute the remaining cells to generate and display image captions.

Notes
-For the best captions, use clear and descriptive images.
-All packages are installed within the notebook for convenience.
